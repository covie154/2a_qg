The approach you're using (one Celery worker with concurrency=5) is generally suitable for your current setup, but there are some considerations to keep in mind based on your specific workload of generating multiple questions concurrently.

Current Setup Analysis
```
# Your current setup (assumed)
celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=5
```

# Recommendations
1. For your current question generation workload:
  * One worker with concurrency=5 is sufficient to handle the generateThreeQuestions task that spawns 3 concurrent subtasks
  * This provides a good balance between resource usage and parallelism
2. Consider multiple workers if:
  * You expect multiple users to simultaneously generate questions
  * Your server has many CPU cores (8+) that aren't being fully utilized
  * Memory usage per task is high (ML models often are)
3. Optimized configuration:
```
# Option 1: Keep current setup but add prefetch multiplier
celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=5 --prefetch-multiplier=1

# Option 2: Multiple workers for better isolation
celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=3 -n worker1@%h
celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=3 -n worker2@%h
```

4. Additional settings to consider:
  * Set --prefetch-multiplier=1 to prevent workers from grabbing too many tasks at once
  * Add task timeouts to prevent stuck tasks: --time-limit=1800
  * Consider using separate queues for different task types
  
For your current scale and use case, a single worker with concurrency=5 is reasonable. If you start experiencing memory issues or need to scale up to handle more simultaneous requests, you can switch to multiple workers.
